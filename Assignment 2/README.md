1. Newton’s forward difference interpolation formula [illustrate for (1, 0), (2, 7.01), (3, 25.91),
(4, 63.014), (5, 123.909)].
2. Newton’s backward difference interpolation formula [illustrate for (1, 0), (2, 7.01), (3,
25.91), (4, 63.014), (5, 123.909)].
3. Lagrange’s interpolation formula, [illustrate for (1, 0), (2, 7.01), (4, 63.014), (5, 123.909), (8,
541)].
