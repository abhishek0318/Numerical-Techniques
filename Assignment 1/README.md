Write computer programs to evaluate simple roots of algebraic equations using the following techniques:

1. Bisection method (Illustrate for x^5 − 25x^4 + 184x^3 − 640x^2 − 2223x − 4095 = 0.)
2. Iteration method (Illustrate for x^3 + x^2 − 1 = 0 and 2x = cosx + 3 correct to 5 decimal places.)
3. Regula falsi method (Illustrate for x sin x + cos x = 0).
4. Newton-Raphson method (Illustrate for x sin x + cos x = 0.)
